# Digital Creative Frontend Test

We want you to develop a search box component with the following requirements:

- The design / look / feel should be on pair with the provided design files.
- The data should be retrieved from the following api: [`GET -> https://frontend-test-api.digitalcreative.cn/?query=flutter`](https://frontend-test-api.digitalcreative.cn/?query=flutter)
- The correct search box state should be shown accordingly with these rules:
    - **Initial State:** No search has been performed yet. [Sample](./assets/examples/initial-state.png)
    - **Search Results:** Display a list of all matching results. [Sample](./assets/examples/search-results-state.png)
    - **No Results:** When the api response return no results. [Sample](./assets/examples/no-results-state.png)

# Goal
- The completed page should accurately represent the design templates

# Rules

- The application has to be developed using `Vue`.
- For styling, you can use whatever you want. We use SASS at DC, but feel free to use what you're more comfortable with.
- Add a `README.md` file with the decisions you took, any information you want to share with us (possible improvements, for example), and the installation instructions.

# What we will be looking for

- A nice architecture. Code is read more than it is written, so the easier it gets to follow your code, folder structure, etc... the better.
- Your UI composition. We'll check how you connect the different components of the application between them and how the data/state flows.
